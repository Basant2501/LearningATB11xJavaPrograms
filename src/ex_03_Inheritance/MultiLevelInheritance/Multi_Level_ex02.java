/*You can only access members (methods/variables) that are declared in Grandfather class, because thatâ€™s the reference type.
However, if the Son or Father classes override a method from Grandfather, the runtime (JVM) will call the overridden version, thanks to dynamic method dispatch.
You cannot directly call Father or Son specific methods using a Grandfather reference, even though the actual object is of type Son.
Because at compile time, the compiler only knows the reference is of type Grandfather, and checks for method availability in that class only.
In order to call we need to downcast*/
